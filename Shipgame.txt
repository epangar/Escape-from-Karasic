ESCAPE FROM KARASIC

GAME LOGIC

Player has to check:
-food rations.
-hunger 6/6
-heat of ship 8/8




You were kidnapped three days ago by smugglers during a space mission to Karasir, a desertic planet. You have managed to escape from their prison, steal some food and a very small, half-broken spaceship. You're trying to get back to your camp, but for that you have to cross the dessert aboard the spaceship.

Don't run out of food or you'll die of hunger.
Don't let the bandits catch you or they will kill you on the spot.
Don't let your spaceship overheat or it will explode and you'll die in the middle of nowhere.


-Once you have travelled 20 miles, there's a 50% each turn that the smugglers notice you're gone and go after you.
	If they don't: you get a message saying nobody has detected your escape.
	The first time they do: you get an alert with a message and they start going after you.
	The rest of the time they keep advancing (10,13 miles).


-every turn there is 20% chance of a random event:
	15% (total) to find a nomad
	10% (total) to find a friendly village
	5% (total) to find a sandstorm.
