 Different objects for player and ship?
 An object for nomads?
 A constructor for nomads? (3 different nomads)
 There is a way to ask the player without a message appearing?
 A d20 for the random events? (Oasis, nomads, sandstorm)? [x]
 Nomad sells: Sandstorm protection shield, turbo, ship cooler, bigger canteen.
 Nomad sells random price?
 Nomad has a minigame for a free price?
